# The-Accurate-Calculator
This is a calculator I made in python. It is GREAT at maths and will answer any division, multiplication, subtraction or addition question you have! Credit to https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/calculator since I got a lot of the code from there, though I did alter it to act very differently.
